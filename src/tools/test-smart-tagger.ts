# Implemented new feature for bulk task creation

Today I completed the implementation of the bulk task creation feature. This was a complex task that required significant effort to handle all the edge cases.

## What was done:
- Added React components for the bulk creation UI
- Implemented API endpoints for batch processing
- Fixed several bugs related to validation
- Added comprehensive unit tests

The feature is now ready for deployment. It took about 3 days to complete.

Status: Done
Priority: High (this was blocking the release)

# Research on Jira Templates System

Conducted comprehensive research on how Jira templates work for task creation. This investigation explored both HR and non-HR use cases.

Key findings:
- Native Jira has limited template support
- Add-ons provide advanced features like variables
- Templates can save 50-80% time on repetitive tasks

This is still in the research phase, need to explore implementation options.

# Quick fix for login bug

Fixed a simple bug where users couldn't login with special characters in password. 
The issue was in the validation regex. 

This was a trivial fix that took about 30 minutes.

# Blocked on API permissions

Can't proceed with the teams integration because we're waiting for the API access approval.
This is becoming a critical blocker for the sprint.

Need urgent resolution from the platform team.
