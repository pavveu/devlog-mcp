# Session Duration Tracking Enhancement

## Summary

I've successfully implemented session duration tracking for the `devlog_workspace_dump` tool in `simple-devlog-server.ts`. This enhancement addresses the inaccurate hour calculations in weekly summaries by capturing precise session timing information.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `parseAgentFromContent` function
- Added `sessionStart` field to the return type
- Now extracts `session_start` timestamp from workspace metadata

### 2. Enhanced `devlog_workspace_claim` tool
- Captures session start time when claiming/creating workspace
- Records `session_start` in workspace metadata as ISO timestamp
- Updates existing workspaces to include session start time

### 3. Added `calculateSessionDuration` helper function
- Calculates precise duration between session start and end
- Returns duration in minutes, hours (decimal), and formatted string
- Handles edge cases (null start time, invalid dates)
- Format examples: "1h 30m", "45m", "< 1m"

### 4. Enhanced `devlog_workspace_dump` tool
- Captures session end time and calculates duration
- Adds timing metadata to dumped session files:
  - `session_start`: ISO timestamp
  - `session_end`: ISO timestamp  
  - `duration_minutes`: Number (for calculations)
  - `duration_hours`: Decimal number (for hourly reporting)
  - `duration` tag: Human-readable format
- Includes session timing section in dumped content
- Shows duration information in success message

### 5. Updated `devlog_workspace_status` tool  
- Shows current session duration for active sessions
- Displays session start time in status report

## New Metadata Fields

Session files now include these fields for accurate time tracking:

```yaml
---
title: "Session: feature-implementation"
date: "2025-06-26T14:30:00.000Z"
agent_id: "agent-250626143000"
session_start: "2025-06-26T13:15:00.000Z"
session_end: "2025-06-26T14:30:00.000Z"
duration_minutes: 75
duration_hours: 1.25
tags:
  type: session
  duration: "1h 15m"
---
```

## Benefits for Weekly Summaries

1. **Accurate Time Calculations**: Duration is calculated from precise timestamps, not estimated
2. **Multiple Format Support**: Minutes for detailed analysis, hours for summaries  
3. **Human-Readable**: Formatted duration strings for reports
4. **Backwards Compatible**: Handles sessions without start times gracefully

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive duration calculation testing:
- 30 minutes → "30m" (0.5h)
- 1h 15m → "1h 15m" (1.25h) 
- 2h 30m → "2h 30m" (2.5h)
- < 1m → "< 1m" (0.01h)
- Invalid/null → Graceful handling

## Usage Example

```bash
# Start session (records start time)
devlog_workspace_claim

# Work on tasks...

# End session (calculates and records duration)
devlog_workspace_dump reason="feature complete"
# Output: Session saved to: daily/2025-06-26-15h45-tuesday-session-feature-complete.md
#         Duration: 1h 30m (90 minutes)
```
